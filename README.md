## üéÆ **How to Play Tetris Game: Emoji Edition**

Tetris Game: Emoji Edition retains the classic Tetris mechanics but introduces a unique visual style using emojis for each Tetrimino. The objective is to strategically place the falling Tetriminos (emoji-shaped blocks) in a way that clears horizontal lines.

### **Objective of the Game:**
Fit the falling Tetriminos into the grid to clear complete rows. The more rows you clear, the more points you get! However, if the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.

### **Controls:**
- **‚Üê (Left Arrow)**: Move the piece to the left.
- **‚Üí (Right Arrow)**: Move the piece to the right.
- **‚Üì (Down Arrow)**: Move the piece down.
- **‚Üë (Up Arrow)**: Rotate the piece (change its orientation).
- **Spacebar**: Hard Drop (instantly drop the piece to the bottom).
- **P**: Pause/Resume the game.
- **Q**: Quit the game.

### **Gameplay Mechanics:**

1. **Falling Tetriminos**: 
   The game consists of falling blocks called Tetriminos, represented by emojis in this version. Each Tetrimino has a different shape, and they fall from the top of the screen. The goal is to fit these blocks into the grid without leaving gaps.

2. **Move and Rotate**:
   - Move blocks left or right using the arrow keys.
   - Rotate the blocks using the **up arrow** to fit them better.
   - Press the **down arrow** to make blocks fall faster. **Press spacebar** for a **hard drop** to instantly drop the block to the bottom.

3. **Clearing Rows**:
   When a row is completely filled with Tetriminos, it will disappear, and you will earn points. Clearing multiple rows at once will earn bonus points!

4. **Game Speed**:
   The game gets progressively harder as you play, with blocks falling faster over time. Choose your difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: Slower falling speed.
   - **Medium**: Moderate falling speed.
   - **Hard**: Fast falling speed for a greater challenge.

5. **End of the Game**:
   The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen, and no more pieces can be placed. The score at the end will be displayed and compared to your high score.

### **Tips & Strategies:**
- **Plan Ahead**: Always think ahead before placing pieces. Don‚Äôt just place pieces randomly.
- **Use Rotation**: Rotate your Tetriminos to fit them into tight spaces and clear more lines.
- **Hard Drop**: Use the spacebar to hard drop the piece if you're in a hurry.
- **Pause for Breaks**: Hit **P** to pause the game whenever you need a break.
